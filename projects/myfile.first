I know my redeemer liveths, I know my redeemer liveths, I know my redeemer liveths, he liveths forever more
I know God loves me , and he will save me , I know God loves me for He is love. And this my song shall be I know God loves me , I know God loves me for He is love. I know my song shall be I know God loves me, I know God loves me for He is love
He is Lord, He is Lord Amen, He has risen from the Lord, He is Lord, every knee shall bowl, every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord
